Pallium Network is a distributed computing network for machine learning.
Like any other distributed network, Pallium Network possesses an increased computing capacity: big tasks get divided into small ones and at the same time they get processed on a number of units.   Architecture dispersion and the absence of the center in a distributed network increase its fault tolerance and widen scaling features for productivity growth.     
Pallium Network is decentralized and self-organized; it forms an eco-system where all processes and events happen among its participants and get regulated directly by them. Pallium Network decentralization allows to level out improper usage and errors appropriate for networks with centralized administration, and equals the rights of all its participants.    
Pallium Network is capable of finding solutions for tasks of any complexity and scale. The main mission of Pallium Network is to contribute to development of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
